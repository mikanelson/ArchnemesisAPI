<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Every few months, I look forward to the release of the next Path of Exile league. With it, new mechanics are introduced,
and all league progress is wiped. However, the Archnemesis league introduced a mechanic that requires careful
management of many "modifiers" - the league's crafting mechanic. In short, modifiers feed into recipes. These recipes
then create further modifiers. [Here](https://i.redd.it/42t8vavix7g81.png) is an example of a fan-made chart 
showcasing the recipes. In order to streamline the process of targeting certain recipes, I created this API.
